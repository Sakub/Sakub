## Hi there 👋

## I'm a Mid Frontend Developer with one and a half years of commercial experience. 🤯

### Since the first half of February 2023, I'm responsible for implementing features in huge ERP System written on top of Angular + RxJS.
##### What is worth mentioning is that I'm the person who introduced Unit Testing in my team and also developed a new approach of writing frontend (mostly concerned on RxJS and state management like in Vuex)
### Also, I have experience in developing Vue 2 + Vuex app, adding features into a Laravel project (frontend and also backend), creating integrations with Microsoft products for internal projects, and lastly, I have experience in task automation with usage of Microsoft PowerAutomate and Microsoft PowerApps.

##### Currently, I'm trying to learn [Rust] and [Vim] so wish me good luck!

##### Main technologies: [Vue] 🖖, [Angular]
##### Current OS: [MacOs] 🍎 (previously [Arch] 🐧)
